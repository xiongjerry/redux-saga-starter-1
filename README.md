# redux-saga-starter
`npm install`

This is the starting repo to accompany 06-03b_redux-saga-intro.md

This is a 3/4 stack app (no DB)
`npm run client` and `npm run server`

Users can input an element on the DOM, hit the submit button. The entry gets saved in an array on the server.

This is using just React-Redux as written. Lecture converts it to use Redux-Saga for the async GET and POST calls.
The boilerplate setup for redux-saga is already done -- see `index.js`
